# OALD isn't included because it's got a more restrictive (non-commercial
# only) license. OALD voices not included for same reason.

# Note on voice versions: I'm simply using the file date of the newest file
# in each set of tarballs. It happens that the dates for all files from each
# source (diphone, cmu_arctic, etc.) match, which is handy.

# Requires: festival-voice
# The hard dep below provides a festival-voice, no need to require it here.

# This is hard-coded as a requirement because it's the smallest voice (and,
# subjectively I think the most pleasant to listen to and so a good
# default).
#
# Ideally, this would be a "suggests" instead of a hard requirement.
#
# Update: with the new nitech versions of the voices, slt-arctic is no
# longer the smallest. But... AWB has a strong scottish accent, and JMK a
# kind of odd canadian one, so they're not great candidates for inclusion.
# And I find RMS a bit hard to understand. BDL isn't much smaller than SLT,
# and since I like it better, I think I'm going to keep it as the default
# for a price 12k. So, in case anyone later questions why this is the
# default, there's the answer. :)

%description
Festival is a general multi-lingual speech synthesis system developed
at CSTR. It offers a full text to speech system with various APIs, as
well as an environment for development and research of speech synthesis
techniques. It is written in C++ with a Scheme-based command interpreter
for general control.

%description -n festvox-kal-diphone
American English male speaker ("Kevin") for Festival.

This voice provides an American English male voice using a residual excited
LPC diphone synthesis method. It uses the CMU Lexicon pronunciations.
Prosodic phrasing is provided by a statistically trained model using part of
speech and local distribution of breaks. Intonation is provided by a CART
tree predicting ToBI accents and an F0 contour generated from a model
trained from natural speech. The duration model is also trained from data
using a CART tree.


%description -n festvox-rab-diphone
British English male speaker ("RAB") for Festival.

This voice provides a British English male voice using a residual excited
LPC diphone synthesis method. It uses the CMU Lexicon for pronunciations.
Prosodic phrasing is provided by a statistically trained model using part of
speech and local distribution of breaks. Intonation is provided by a CART
tree predicting ToBI accents and an F0 contour generated from a model
trained from natural speech. The duration model is also trained from data
using a CART tree.


%description -n festvox-awb-arctic-hts
US English male speaker ("AWB") for Festival. AWB is a native Scottish
English speaker, but the voice uses the US English front end.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1138 utterances spoken by a Scottish English male speaker. The
speaker is very experienced in building synthetic voices and matched
prompted US English, though his vowels are very different from US English
vowels. Scottish English speakers will probably find synthesizers based on
this voice strange. Unlike the other CMU_ARCTIC databases this was recorded
in 16 bit 16KHz mono without EGG, on a Dell Laptop in a quiet office. The
database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx using the FestVox
labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.


%description -n festvox-bdl-arctic-hts
US English male speaker ("BDL") for Festival.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1132 utterances spoken by a US English male speaker. The speaker
is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at 16bit
32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform, the
other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx using
the FestVox labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.


%description -n festvox-clb-arctic-hts
US English female speaker ("CLB") for Festival.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1132 utterances spoken by a US English female speaker. The
speaker is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at
16bit 32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform,
the other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx
using the FestVox labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.


%description -n festvox-jmk-arctic-hts
US English male speaker ("JMK") voice for Festival. JMK is a native Canadian
English speaker, but the voice uses the US English front end.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1138 utterances spoken by a US English male speaker. The speaker
is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at 16bit

%description -n festvox-rms-arctic-hts
US English male speaker ("RMS") voice for Festival.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1132 utterances spoken by a US English male speaker. The speaker
is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at 16bit
32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform, the
other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using EHMM an HMM labeler
that is included in the FestVox distribution. No hand correction has been
made.

%description -n festvox-slt-arctic-hts
US English female speaker ("SLT") voice for Festival.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice

- Update to Matthew Miller's much improved package (#232105)
- Move the buildroot patch around

* Sun Mar 18 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.9
- fix the library link patch to use -lncurses instead of -ltinfo --
  the later is all that's really needed, but the former works on older
  distros too.

* Fri Mar 16 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.8
- festival-devel depends on the libraries package, not base festival. this
  raises an multilib question: need to obsolete festival.i386 on x86_64.
  Right now, there's no mechanism for doing that. Fortunately, all the
  changes in packaging happen to make it so that the current version doesn't
  conflict with the old release, so one will get unused cruft but not
  breakage when upgrading.
- Bite teh proverbial bullet and make libFestival build shared.
- update speech-tools soname patch to work in the more general case needed
  by the festival main build
- make said shared-lib a subpackage to avoid multiarching the whole thing
- split festival-devel and speechutils-devel in anticipation of future
  plan of actually decoupling these packages.
- note that rpmlint complains about "missing" deps on the devel packages. it
  should be fixed to recognize requiring a -lib/libs package is sufficent or
  better.
- add saytime script. Because, really, what else is this package *for*?
- add the intro.text so (intro) works. 196 more bytes won't kill us. :)
- remove $PATH from LD_LIBRARY_PATH used in build. (What the heck?)
- add defattr to all subpackages. I don't think it's strictly necessary
  since putting it in the first package seems sufficient, but that's
  probably not behavior to count on.
- make descriptions and summaries use more consistant language

* Thu Mar 15 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.7
- Upstream baseurl now includes version. (Thanks Alan Black @ cmu)
- Update siteinit patch to also incorporate sitevars
- Add sitevars as a config file
- Ship our own siteinit and sitevars as sources
- In default sitevars, reference /usr/local/share/festival/lib as another
  place to look for voices (it's okay if that doesn't exist). Hopefully,
  this will encourage people who want to install non-RPM-packaged voices to
  keep from doing it in /usr/share.
- Fix wrong references to slt voice in other nitech voices
- Fix wrongly commented-out (require 'f2bf0lr) in awb, clb, and rms voices.
- Stop untarring source files and use the setup macro properly.
- Get rid of silly DATA.TMP directories for installing voices and 
  dictionaries.
- Stop making ../speechtools link. Currently solved by patching to look
  in the current directory; could also do this by moving everything up
  a directory.
- TODO: festival-buildroot.patch could stand to be updated. May not
  even be needed anymore.
- Drop the 8k versions of the diphone voices, since there's not really
  any point. If you want smaller, use one of the arctic_hts voices
  instead. And overall, this saves us about 4.5M.

* Wed Mar 14 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.6
- Fix copy-paste error in JMK description (thanks Matthias Clasen)
- Remove "nitech-us-" from the names of those voice packages to make the
  package names shorter. (This will also be more convenient if we switch to
  the cmu versions in the future.)
- made aliases so old cmu_us_*_arctic_hts voice names still work.
- Look for /etc/festival/siteinit.scm (and move siteinit.scm there!)
- Mark siteinit.scm as a config file
- Remove some non-useful stuff from speech-tools-utils.
- Move main dir from /usr/share/festival to /usr/share/festival/lib at
  request of upstream. Also, we can drop the FHS (well, "fsstnd" -- it's
  old) patch and just pass FTLIBDIR to make. Which, hey, we were already
  doing. Yay redundancy.
- clean up CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS. "-fpermissive" was hiding bad stuff.
- update speech tools with patch from AWB to fix 64-bit build issue 
  with EST_DProbDist
- there's still some compiler warnings which should be addressed upstream.
- The nitech hts voices don't properly proclaim_voice, making them not
  show up for gnome-speech and thus making orca crash. See details in the
  comments in bug #232105.

* Tue Mar 13 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.5
- use festvox- instead of festival-voice for voice packages -- matches
  upstream tarballs, and is shorter. Also, use shorter form of
  the date-based version.
- get the README.htsvoice from the nitech voices -- it contains
  license info.
- build (but don't enable by default) ESD support in speech-tools (bug
  #198908)
- fix coding error noted in bug #162137 -- need to push this upstream.
- link speech tools libraries with -lm, -ltermcap, -lesd and with themselves
  (bug #198190, partially)
- holy sheesh. Use g++ for CXX, not gcc. Fixes bug #198190 completely.

* Tue Mar 13 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.4
- subpackages! Split out speech-tools, docs, voices.
- long descriptions for the individual voices, carefully gathered from
  readmes and web sites.
- ooh. replace cmu_hts voices with the updated versions from upstream
  <http://hts.sp.nitech.ac.jp/>. Two new voices, and updated versions of
  the others. (The voices packaged at festvox.org are apparently based on
  older versions of these, which in turn are from the CMU upstream.)
- TODO: make aliases for the cmu voices.
- arguably, voices should be made in to their own src.rpms. They don't need
  anything from here to build. That's for a future version. (At that time,
  the gigantic multisyn voices could be added.) The CMU dict needs festival
  installed to build, but I don't think it needs the source, so dicts could
  be subpackages too. And the docs are also a good candidate for separation.
  speech-tools, though, is incestuously used in the festival build process
  and I think it makes sense to keep that bundled.
- TODO: check through the speechtools-utils for what should actually be 
  packaged; fix the include path for siod (and anything else that needs it).
- TODO: package festival.el so it just works with emacs.
- TODO: reinvent festival_server_control as a proper init script
- TODO: put the festival server in sbin, maybe?
- Another question: should we drop the 8k diphone voices? Any point?
- Changed "X11-like" to "MIT-style" (which is what X11 is) to make rpmlint
  happy.
- make %%{festivalversion} macro to deal with all of the changes to version
  in subpackages. Kludgy, but there's RPM for you.

* Tue Mar 13 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.3
- oh! The "etc-path" is important after all. Map that into
  /usr/lib[arch]/festival via a kludge.
- make cmu_us_slt_arctic_hts the default voice, in preparation for
  splitting the voice packages. (thankfully, there's already a fallback
  mechanism -- cool!)

* Mon Mar 12 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.2
- clean up accidental backup file left in updated awb_arctic_hts 
  tarball
- remove /usr/share/festival/etc (see bug #228315)
- move unpackage voices to the prep section where it belongs
- other minor spec file readability changes
- "make install" for this package is, um, "interesting". It seems
  geared for local user-level builds. So, rather than doing that and
  then patching it up, do the right parts by hand as necessary. (The
  previous version of the spec file did a convoluted mix of both.)
- don't install static libs.
- took out the massive hack that munges EST_*.h to speech_tools/EST_*.h in
  the installed header files -- programs should instead use
  -I/usr/include/speech_tools, shouldn't they? Put this back if I'm wrong.
- TODO -- autogenerated speech_tools docs
- festvox_ellpc11k.tar.gz, the spanish voice, wasn't getting installed anyway
  due to a license question. Since it's also gone upstream, removing.

* Fri Mar 09 2007 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.96-0.1
- Preliminary update to 1.96
- Update to new cmu_us_*_arctic files -- they're changed upstream,
  although they don't appear to be versioned. Awesome. The current
  versions are those found in the same directory with the 1.96 files.
- ditto festlex_CMU.tar.gz
- add macro for speechtoolsversion
- minor update to festival-1.96-american.patch.
- update shared build patch and rename to make more obvious that
  it applies to the speechtools portion of the package.
- gcc 4 build patches now upstream.
- localhost-connections patch now upstream.
- note that festvox_ellpc11k.tar.gz and festvox_kallpc8k.tar.gz are no longer 
  in the directory tree upstream; drop?

- patch from Matthew Miller to update to 1.95.  Full changelog below

* Mon Feb  7 2005 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.95-0.mattdm8
- put speech-tools binaries in /usr/libexec/speech-tools so as to not
  clutter /usr/bin. Another approach would be to make speech-tools a 
  separate package and to make these utilities a subpackage of that.
- macro-ize /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /usr/include

* Sun Feb  6 2005 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.95-0.mattdm6
- worked on this some more
- made actually work -- put back rest of fsstnd patch which I had broken
- made kludge for lack of sonames in shared libraries -- I think I did the
  right thing
- put back american as the default -- british dicts are non-free.

* Wed Jan  5 2005 Matthew Miller <mattdm@mattdm.org> 1.95-0.mattdm1
- preliminary update to 1.95 beta
- add really nice CMU_ARCTIC HTS voices, which is the whole point of wanting
  to do this. (They have a free license.)
- switch to festvox.org north american upstream urls
- keep old doc files -- there's no new ones yet.
- add comment to specfile about reason for lack of OALD (British) voices --
  they've got a more restrictive license.
- change license to "X11-style", because that's how they describe it.
- remove exclusivearch. I dunno if this builds on other archs, but I
  also don't know why it wouldn't.
- fancier buildroot string, 'cause hey, why not.
- more "datadir" macros
- remove most of Patch0 (fsstnd) -- can be done by setting variables instead.
  there's some bits in speechtools still, though
- update Patch3 (shared-build)
- don't apply patches 20 and 21 -- no longer needed.
- disable adding "FreeBSD" and "OpenBSD" to the dictionary for now. Probably
  a whole list of geek words should be added. Also, the patch was applied
  in an icky kludgy way.
